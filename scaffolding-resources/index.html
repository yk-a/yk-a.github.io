        <h2>About</h2>
          <p>This is a page of resources for A Study Into Scaffolding, a 2022 architecture diploma project at AHO. The actual diploma explores methods of repair through the secondary structures that facilitate this process - scaffolding.</p>
          <!--<td>Unlike buildings and monuments, which only become what they are when built, scaffolding refers to both the unbuilt components and built structures. </br></br>Treated as temporary and secondary to whatever it is associated with, scaffolding in its assembled form separates the built from its environment primarily for pragmatic reasons. It is a visual indicator of change, yet - especially in cities - it is invisible despite its ubiquity.</td>

        <p>References here. The diploma explores both the literal and figurative dimensions of scaffolding. Each reference has been marked against a matrix on how it approaches / uses scaffolding as a way to organise the wide net of reading. Column headers can be clicked to sort by ascending / descending order.</p>
